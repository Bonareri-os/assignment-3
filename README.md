1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure deadlines are met?
   
Timely delivery ensures client satisfaction, reduces costs, and maintains a competitive edge. Project managers can ensure deadlines are met by setting realistic timelines, using project management tools, prioritizing tasks, conducting regular progress reviews, and managing risks proactively.

2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
   
Effective cost control ensures financial sustainability, prevents resource wastage, and enhances profitability. Strategies include thorough budget planning, continuous cost monitoring, using cost-tracking tools, setting contingency reserves, and adjusting scope when necessary.

3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile:

Advantages: Flexible, iterative, quick feedback loops, client involvement, faster delivery.

Disadvantages: Difficult to predict costs and timelines, requires active client participation, may lead to scope creep.
Waterfall:

Advantages: Clear structure, well-documented process, better for fixed-scope projects.

Disadvantages: Inflexible, late-stage issue detection, slow adaptation to changes.

4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
   
Agile: Best for dynamic, evolving projects like software startups, mobile apps, or SaaS platforms.
Example: Developing a ride-hailing app.

Waterfall: Best for well-defined, structured projects like government systems, banking software, or regulatory compliance applications. 

Example: A tax-filing system.

5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

Methods include automated testing, code reviews, continuous integration, user feedback, and adherence to coding standards. High quality ensures reliability, security, and user satisfaction, reducing maintenance costs and failures.

6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
   
A well-defined scope prevents scope creep, aligns stakeholders, and provides a clear roadmap. WBS breaks down the project into manageable tasks, improving resource allocation, tracking, and execution efficiency.

7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
   
A detailed schedule improves task coordination, resource planning, and deadline adherence. Gantt charts visually map project timelines, dependencies, and progress, aiding in clear communication and tracking.

8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
   
It addresses gaps in healthcare access and lifestyle-related disease prediction, helping individuals and healthcare providers make informed decisions to improve health outcomes.

9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
   
A well-defined problem ensures targeted development, minimizes wasted resources, and aligns the solution with user needs and market demand.

10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
    
It’s a smart healthcare tool that analyzes lifestyle factors to predict and prevent diseases, helping users make healthier choices.

11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
    
Key features include AI-driven risk analysis, personalized health recommendations, user-friendly dashboards, and real-time data integration.

12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
    
The digital health market is rapidly growing, driven by increased adoption of AI in healthcare and demand for preventive solutions. Market research is needed for precise figures.

13. How can understanding market trends inform your software’s positioning and development?
    
It helps identify user preferences, anticipate future needs, refine features, and develop competitive pricing and marketing strategies.
